# Git_Hello_World Kat's Copy

Here are your tasks for the day:

1: Create a new branch
- 
This allows you to edit what you see fit, and then have those edits saved on github

3: Edit the README.md
- 
This is just editing this file

4: Commit your changes to your forked repository
- 
This allows the changes to be saved to your current branch on github

5: Open a new pull request
-
This lets me know you've finished your edits, and are ready to discuss the edits being added to my master file

6: Then, I will merge your pull request with the master, solidifying your changes
- 
// lots of edits

Also good to note: 
- 
If you want to make your own github project based on another, you can fork it
This will essentially copy the repo into a new one under your account
